One of my favourite features of Ruby on Rails is the testing philosophy it has baked in. In fact the proliferation of Test-Driven Development probably has a lot to thank Rails for. When you generate a new project, you don't supply a switch to generate tests. You get a /test folder *by default*.

It also introduced me to the idea of test fixtures.
