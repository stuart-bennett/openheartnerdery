###Credits
This site uses the following fonts:
  <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Karla">Karla</a>,
  <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto Condensed</a>,
  <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sanchez">Sanchez</a>

###Technology

The content on this site is marked up with HTML5. During development, aesthetics are handled by <a href="http://compass-style.org/" class="external">Compass</a> and are crushed into tiny bits of CSS by <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" class="external">Grunt</a> when I command the source code to be built.

When publishing, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" class="external">Jekyll</a> makes sure the it all goes smoothly.

If you really want to, you can build this site for yourself. Grab the source code from <a href="https://github.com/stuart-bennett/openheartnerdery" class="external">GitHub</a>.
