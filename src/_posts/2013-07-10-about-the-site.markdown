A little description of how this site is developed.

####Technology

The content on this site is marked up with HTML5. During development, aesthetics are handled by <a href="http://compass-style.org/" class="external">Compass</a> and are crushed into tiny bits of CSS by <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" class="external">Grunt</a> when I command the source code to be built.

When publishing, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" class="external">Jekyll</a> makes sure the it all goes smoothly.

If you really want to, you can build this site for yourself. Grab the source code from <a href="https://github.com/stuart-bennett/openheartnerdery" class="external">GitHub</a>. Build instructions are <a href="https://github.com/stuart-bennett/openheartnerdery/blob/master/readme.md#pre-requisites">available</a>.

####Credits
This site uses the following fonts:
  <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Karla">Karla</a>,
  <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto Condensed</a>,
  <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sanchez">Sanchez</a>


####Compatibility

The site is designed to work across *all* major desktop and mobile browsers. The site is designed to adapt to it's available features so it is intentional the layout will differ between varying resolution devices such as mobiles to desktop monitors. There are no serious reasons why the site wouldn't work on older browsers too but anything pre IE7 has not been tested.

If you find any restricting issues around compatibility with the software you are using to browse the site, please let <a href="mailto:openheartednerd@gmail.com">email me</a>, with any screenshots and/or steps to reproduce the problem and I'll be sure to fix any issues.
